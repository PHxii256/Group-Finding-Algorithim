Picks in relaxed mode dont have to be from mac pool after the first one

Investigate max allowed premade nodes count in a group. (currently it's disallowing duplicate pairs i think), should we allow it? 

add max groups for a node per algo run check

add group rating to graph gen and add the +ve group rating constraint for the algo

create bar chart showing failure reasons as a % of total fails


unnesesary optimisations for later:
- memoise failed paths due to empty mac pool
(without the intersection filter ie. which depends on path context)

- use the seed age tie breaker for equal total edge weights, for improved fairness
